# Known issues

The point cloud of the camera is not published to the correct frame or with the correct orientation, as reported here: https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/243

The camera parameters are not set correctly, and are currently taken from a Realsense R200 plugin. Addition of the "real" camera parameters and topics is very welcome.
