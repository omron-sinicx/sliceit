# Introduction

THIS PACKAGE IS MOSTLY DEPRECATED.

This package should offer skills and high-level actions used by the state machine and other nodes to navigate through the task, such as "pick", "place", "insert" etc.

Please refer to the service and action tutorials [here](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib/Tutorials) to learn how to use actions. There is an example in o2ac_examples as well.
